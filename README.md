Trained machine learning models for fantasy football.

## Team Recveiving Model (/team-recv)

Predicts a team's total receiving fantasy points potential. This is used by the receiving and rushing model to predict individual receiver and running back performance.

## Team Rushing Model (/team-rush)

Predicts a team's total rushing fantasy points potential. This is used by the rushing model to predict individual running back performance.

## QB Model (/qb)

Predict quarterback performance.

## RB Model (/rb)

Predicts running back performance.

## WR 1,2,3 (/wr/wr1, /wr/wr2, /wr/wr3)

Predicts receiver performance based on predicted starting role.

## TE (/te)

Predicts tight end performance.

## K (/k)

Predicts kicker performance.

## DST (/dst)

Predicts team defense/special teams performance.

## Getting Model Data

You can calculate your own values to feed the model (more details soon on how to do this), or you can get computed data using Plotmark's statistics.
